# bol.com Retailer API

Hello, and welcome to our Retailer API beta support page! This page has been created in order to facilitate a more agile development cycle for the Retailer API, and to enable retailers to provide input. You can provide your input by leaving commments on feature requests, by adding new requests or by simply pressing the like (or don't like) button.

Additionally, the following rules apply when using this page:

•	Please realise that there is only a small team managing this page. Response times on GitHub can be much slower than on the standard partnerservice support channel: https://developers.bol.com/contactformulier/

•	Please only use the public Github page for support questions on Beta endpoints and for input on new roadmap features. 

•	For support on the v2 or v3 versions, please use the standard partnerservice support channel.

•	If you need help developing your connections, please contact the partnerservice support channel after checking out our help documentation: https://developers.bol.com/apiv3gettingstarted/.

•	Please be polite to fellow developers and to our support staff when leaving comments.

•	This page and the public sharing of our roadmap should be seen as a pilot. Please adhere to the rules above to ensure this is a success.

The issue overview on this GitHub page is not prioritized. For the priorities on our roadmap, please see our roadmap page on developers.bol.com.
